# Virtus::Representable

A quick and dirty code spike to generate Representable decorators out of a Virtus tree without typing too much.

Currently only on a "I need that" basis.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'virtus-representable'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install virtus-representable

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## TODO

* write a README
* support all kinds of Representers, not only Decorators
* support Hash attributes
* remove the active_support dependency
